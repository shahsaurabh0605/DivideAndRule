# Divide And Rule

Our world is surrounded by machines, computers, mobile phones using all kinds of technology. Are we really utilizing the amazing computing power of these resources? Do we feel frustrated when your CPU utilization reaches 100%? What if you could borrow your friend's machine and complete the task? Or why not just utilize the power of idle machines around us to get the job done? 
Therefore, via Divide And rule we thought of bringing to you such a 'processor lending and borrowing' technique in the most hassle free way.  

**Why should you use Divide And Rule?**

1. It is cost effective. In the general distributed computing, we are dependent on big companies for providing us compute power and we have to pay a hefty amount for the same. Usually, you perform your distributed computing tasks on multiple machines from cloud companies. With our architecture, you can leverage the idle computing power from anyone.
2. There are several volunteer computing platforms like BOINC, GridCoin, etc. But all of them suffer from a common problem - complex installation process. Here you just connect to a url in your browser and that's it. 
3. Our approach is language-agnostic. Your job as a developer is to give us your pre-existing distributed code. We scale it with all the browsers available to us and produce result.

**How is this possible?**

Divide and Rule is an application which allows you to run your job in a distributed way such that it utilizes compute power of all the machines connected to us. Just do the following:
1. Create a distributed task in any language of your choice.
2. We compile your distributed code into a web assembly and execute it on a browser.
3. Let others connect to our application via the URL we provide so that they can give their idle processors for your work.
4. That's all for you. We will schedule your work in a distributed fashion and generate your output :)
